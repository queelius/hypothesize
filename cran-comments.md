## Notes

This package provides a consistent API for hypothesis testing in R, designed
around principles from SICP (data abstraction, closure property, higher-order
functions). It implements z-tests, Wald tests, likelihood ratio tests, Fisher's
method for combining p-values, and multiple testing corrections.
