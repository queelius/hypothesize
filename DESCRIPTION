Description: Provides a consistent API for hypothesis testing built on
    principles from 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs':
    data abstraction, closure (combining tests yields tests), and
    higher-order functions (transforming tests). Implements z-tests,
    Wald tests, likelihood ratio tests, Fisher's method for combining
    p-values, and multiple testing corrections. Designed for use by
    other packages that want to wrap their hypothesis tests in a
    consistent interface.
